# Covid-Cases-Analysis
Analysis of Covid Cases and Deaths for Year 2018 - 2021

This is my first Tableau Dashboard

Findings - 
1. Dataset was clean with no missing values
2. Only 1 table exists so need to set the relationships
3. There are more dimension values and less measure values

Analysis -
1. Import the data in Tableau
2. Check all the datatypes and change accordingly
3. Create individual charts for all the columns
4. Create dashboard
